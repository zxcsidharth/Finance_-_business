investement karne se pehle apna age goal set karo and then money goal set karo and then calculate ki kitne ka return millega to you will be able to achieve that.
agar short term me kuch paise kamane hain to then you will have to rely on the other form of investement like stock, equity maybe hybrid mutual fund and other form of investement because for a short term like 5-8 years you can not rely on the mutual fund investement, you will have to be intelligent enough to invest in other form of investement.

Equity small cap me invest kar sakte hain for short term and for long term(for more than 20 year) i can choose large cap top 50.


Three type of mutual fund:-

##### Large Cap:- 
best for long term
- and here i can choose high volatile stocks also because in long term this will compensate the loss.

##### Mid cap:-

##### Small Cap:- 
isko hamesa short term investement k liye rakho, 
and for short term investement always pick the low volatile stocks. low volatile ka matlab ki daily level pr unn stocks me jyada uchal kudd nai ho.


Mutual funds plans are of two types:-
1. Regular plan:- isme kya hota hai bich ka koi party involve hota hai like bank ya koi agent jo wo v hmse kuch commision khata hai.
2. Direct Plan:- Isme kya hota hai ki hum direct uss mutual fund me paisa dal rhe hote hain jinme hmko dalna hai bich me koi nai hota hai jo paisa khaye


Mutual funds are  of two types:- 
1. Growth:- isme kya hota hai ki agar ek sal k investement ka suppose return 10 % aaya to wo usi me add ho jayega and uspr coumponding chalega.
2. Dividend:- Isme kya hoga ki jo 10% ka return aayega wo aapke bank account me har sal nikal k dal denge, but iska loss kya hai ki isme aapke base balance to utne ho reh jayenge hamesa so compounding nai hoga yaha pr.


Now my investement journey have to be started like this way:-

I will invest in small cap with 20 % of my money.
I will invest in mid cap with 15% and 15% in large cap.

Search about all the Large cap companies and mid cap companies ko searchkar k nikalo aur agar acha rhega to usme lumpsum investement karo.
