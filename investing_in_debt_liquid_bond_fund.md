### What is liquid fund?
- Liquid funds wo fund hote hain jisme ki mutual fund wale companies debt ya trssury bills me invest karte hain, like govt tresury, bank securites or bonds. to iss wajah se inko bahut secure mana jata hai.
- Isme return hmko 6-7% mill sakta hai.
- Iska use hum iss liye karte hain ki FD k jitna return paa lete hain hum log aur jab chahe tab bech v sakte hain.
- Isme expense ratio jitna kam ho utna badhiya rhega. kyunki returns kam hota hai to expense ration ek burden feel hone lagta hai isme.
### Taxation in Liquid mutual fund?
--> Here tax is applied on based on the taxation slab of the individual.

### Factor deciding the good liquid funds:-
- First thing is that we should not consider the retusn as the differentiating factor, because here we are for safety of the money, not to grow our money.
- So First check the size of the AMC, heavier the size of the AMC, better it is.
- Then see the Time since inception, basically it tells me how many months old the fund is?
- Then check the safety proportion, it means that how much %age of fund is invested in A rated bonds. Higher the percentage higher the safety is.
- Then after that we can check the expense ratio, and lower the expense ratio better it is. 
- After that check the 3 year return and 5 year return. yaha pr agar minor difference hai to usko neglect kar sakta hu mai.
- Then finally i can check the sharp ratio, Higher the Sharp ratio better the risk adjusted returns of the mutual fund is.
### Some of the best liquid mutual fund?
- Aditya birla sunlife, HDFC liquid fund, SBI liquid fund. 
### Ultra short mutual fund:- 
- They also invest in the Debt, tressury bills, and debentures which are as safe as liquid funds, But difference is liquid fund matures in 90 days but the ultra short duration fund expires in the 6 month.  
- so agar immediately aapko paisa chahiye to Liquid fund better hai because yaha pr humko ek ghante se lekar 1 din tak me paisa mill jata hai. But Ultra short mutual fund me 1 din ka time lag sakta hai. 
- Isme retrun thora better hota hai, But expense ratio v thora jyada hota hai.
