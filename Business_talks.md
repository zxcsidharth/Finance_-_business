### Dropshiping Business:-

to start a drop shiping business we should first do the following things to start on that.
- First research the product that you want to sell.
- And also before that if you don't have the product to sell then you can research on internet that that what are the things that are more in demand. or trending. for that i can use tools like google trend and bing trend or some other website which can tell us the data for those items.
- then check the price of that item on the indiamart and also its price on amazon flipkart, meesho and if the margin is good then i can choose that item to sell.
- Also if there is any plan of selling your product on your website then try to build the website using shopify.

##### Marketing:-
Once you are done with the product finalisation then for marketing i can use social media to do the marketing like insta reels or post or facebook post.
- i can use google add also, and can research on various other tools that i can use to do advertisement.


### Digital sale:-
- try to figure out first that what are the things that i can sell it out.
- after that do research on the items that how much user it can get.
- and then focus on the selling of the product.

I can open a channel which can be used to share the business news around the globe or indian business for now, and do the case study of the business and latest business stuff in the market.
	Like `backstage with Millionaires`  or `Lapas voice` 
	aur usi me hum alag alag playlist bana sakte hain ya fir alag alag chjannel jaha pr ki Business k case studies ya indian startup ka news share kar sakte hain..weekly.

for example agar indian startup kaa bat karna hai to uske liye mai alag se playlist start kar sakta hu. and lapas voice ki tarah har ek ya do din me business news de sakta hu but i will have to figure out that what difference i will make when compared to lapas voice basically i will have to create my own space or say segment where i would have to see what difference i can make.

- isme mujhe acha khasa sponsorship mill sakta hai.
- Aur fir aage chal kar mai isko use kar sakta hu for podcast with the founders or business folks.
