### Dropshiping Business:-

to start a drop shiping business we should first do the following things to start on that.
- First research the product that you want to sell.
- And also before that if you don't have the product to sell then you can research on internet that that what are the things that are more in demand. or trending. for that i can use tools like google trend and bing trend or some other website which can tell us the data for those items.
- then check the price of that item on the indiamart and also its price on amazon flipkart, meesho and if the margin is good then i can choose that item to sell.
- Also if there is any plan of selling your product on your website then try to build the website using shopify.

##### Marketing:-
Once you are done with the product finalisation then for marketing i can use social media to do the marketing like insta reels or post or facebook post.
- i can use google add also, and can research on various other tools that i can use to do advertisement.


### Digital sale:-
- try to figure out first that what are the things that i can sell it out.
- after that do research on the items that how much user it can get.
- and then focus on the selling of the product.

I can open a channel which can be used to share the business news around the globe or indian business for now, and do the case study of the business and latest business stuff in the market.
	Like `backstage with Millionaires`  or `Lapas voice` 
	aur usi me hum alag alag playlist bana sakte hain ya fir alag alag chjannel jaha pr ki Business k case studies ya indian startup ka news share kar sakte hain..weekly.

for example agar indian startup kaa bat karna hai to uske liye mai alag se playlist start kar sakta hu. and lapas voice ki tarah har ek ya do din me business news de sakta hu but i will have to figure out that what difference i will make when compared to lapas voice basically i will have to create my own space or say segment where i would have to see what difference i can make.

- isme mujhe acha khasa sponsorship mill sakta hai.
- Aur fir aage chal kar mai isko use kar sakta hu for podcast with the founders or business folks.

#### Before starting the channel what are the things that i can do to start my work.

- Get to know that from where i can get the business news and startup news.
- What are types of contents i can make initially and later i will have to drive my channel with the help of data.
- background kaise change kar sakte hain apna during video shooting.
- Jab koi content creator content banana start karta hai especially research based content then wo kaise content ko design karte hain. and kya ye kaam koi aadmi akele kar skata hai ya usko iske sath me kisi aur aadmi ko v rakhna padega?
- Kya kya equipment mere pass hona chahiye for initial startup.
- kaunsa video edit k liye tool use karna sahi rhega?
- Also Kya kya chalenges aayenge jab mai inme utrunga
- Graphic design kaun karega and kaise kiya jayega ya koi tarika hai ki khud se kiya jaa sakta hai?
- Hindi me banaye ya english me .
- Topics kaha se laye videos k liye ye v long term sustainability k liye jaruri hai.


Envisioned Roadmap:-
- Pehle business news se suru karna hai
- fir startup playlist series chalana hai like `backstage with millionaire` 
- then at advance level i will have to do the case studies of the business. 
- also bich bich me suppose kahin se kuch sikhne ko milla ya motivational stuff milla kuch dekh kar ya kisi videos ko dekh kar to wo mai shorts bana kar dal sakta hu, insta and youtube shorts pr.
- At the same time i will have to project myself as the business coach and then start working on the bringing paid seminars jo aajkal k coach log kar re hain.
- and Future me jab acha audience ho jaye to fir i can start selling my own course. about the business studies.
- agar knowledge utna ho jaye to i can write some books for that.

- Jab channel agar acha grow kar raha ho to mai apne audience ko bol sakta hu ki guys aaj k samay tech ko samjhne aur uspr batein karna v jaruri hain because bahut sare log apna khud ka startup karna chahte hain but uunko tech ka understanding nai hai to uske liye hum ek alag channel launch kar rhe hain jispr ki hamare sath tech k instructor ye honge and ye hamare sath bahut closely kaam karenge. and mai kirtesh ya koi aur hoga to usko apne sath milla kar ek tech ka series chala sakta hu jaha pr ki tech ki batein hongi ya tech case studies banaya jaa sakta hai.
- and ache follower ka matlab hai ki fir to mai ek blogging channel v bana sakta hu. khud ka personal kahin ghumne firne gaye to uske liye. 
- aage chal kar hum apna kuch v brand launch kar skate hain and since we would be having an audience the we will be easily able to find out the customers.
- and kal ko business ki batein karte karte hamare pass itna knowledge ho jayega aur business ki samajh ho jayegi and also hamare pass paisa ho jayeg to hum log kal ko kuch kuch achi business me v paise dal sakte hain or startups ko fund v kar sakte hain.
- iska agla benefits ye v hai ki agar koi naya business hame start karne padega agar to hum usko v kar skate hain easily and more better ways than any other person because hamare pass achi khasi audience hogi and then also hamare pass ek acha khasa research karne ki capacity and perhaps team v hogi jo kafi deep level pr uska analysis kar sakta hai.
  So basically hamare pass audience hoga which can be coverted into consumers, paise honge to invest in anything and also hamare pass research team and khud ka bahut acha knowledge hoga, combining these three things we could be confident enough to put our hand dirty in any business.
