### 1. P/E RATIO:-

P/E ratio is the ratio of the price of per share to its earning per share. it is used to find out if a stock is undervalued or overvalued. 
It signifies the amount of money an investor is willing to invest in a single share of a company for Re. 1 of its earnings. For instance, simple bhasa me kahe agar to  ki kisi company ka P/E ratio agar 20 hai to iska matlab hai ki agar aap uss company ka stock me agar 20 rs kamayenge to aap ek rupya kamayenge. 
So agar high P/E value hue to matlab aap jyada rupya laga rhe hain uss company me to earn one rupee. 

***HIGH PE***:- 
So agar kisi company ka PE ratio high hai to iska matlab hai ki company k shares ne earning utna nai diya but price iske badhte jaa rhe hain. uska matlab ye ho sakte hain.
- Company ka share overvalued ho gaya hai and bss price iske badhte jaa rhe hain, but earnings nai badh rhe hain company k.
- Ya to aisa kuch speculation nikal k samne aaya hoga ki company k prifit and growth badhne wale hain future me ya koi acha news nikal k samne aaya hoga. to uss wajah se share badh gaye honge.

***LOW PE:-*** 
Agar kisi company ka PE low hai to it signifies the undervalues stock and considered as a good sign, but not always.
- Ye v ho sakta hai ki company ka koi bura news k wajah se uska share price ghat gaya hai.
- Or else company bura perform kar rhi hai to koi share kharid nai raha hai. 
So hame aur indicators ko use karna padega to know fully, agar company ka PE low hai and all other things are very good then definately go for it, that will be a purely value investing.
#### Types of Price to Earnings Ratio

There are primarily two types of P/E Ratio which investors take into consideration – forward P/E ratio and trailing P/E ratio. Both these types of P/E Ratio depend on the nature of earnings, as explained below – 

Forward P/E Ratio
-------------------------------
isko calculate karne k liye hum divide karte hain kisi company k eksingle stock price ko with the estimated earning jo ki company future me de sakti hai. bss yehi hai.  it is also called an estimated P/E Ratio. 

Investors use forward Price to Earnings Ratio to assess how a company is expected to perform in the future and its estimated growth rate. 

Trailing P/E Ratio
-------------------------------
Trailing P/E Ratio is the most commonly used metrics by investors; wherein past earnings of a company over a period is considered. It provides a more accurate and objective view of a company’s performance.

Understanding a good P/E ratio
------------------------------------------------------
Jab hum PE ratio dekhte hain to hmko chahiye ki PE ratio dekhne k sath sath ye v dekhe ki uska peer companies ka PE ratio kaisa hai. comparison karne se pata chalega ki kya sabke PE ratio badhe ya ghate hain ys kuch companies k average v hain.

 For eg:- if Company A has a P/E ratio of 40% and Company B with similar characteristics in the same industry demonstrates a ratio of 10% it essentially means that shareholders of company A have to pay Rs. 40 for Re. 1 of their earnings and shareholders of company B have to pay Rs. 10 for Re. 1 of their earnings. Hence, in this instance, investing in Company B might be more profitable.

Waise to PE ratio sirf akela growth ko nai decide karta hai but han value stock ka pata jarur de sakta hai. 
So aaj k samay on an average the PE ration we can consider is 20, because nifty v hamesa 10 to 30 k bich me apna PE ratio maintain karta hai kai salon se to average hum 20 maan sakte hain.

Limitations of P/E Ratio
-------------------------------------
PE ratio akela hi hum bss use nai kar sakte ki stock badhiya hai ya kharab, haan undervalue and overvalue ka pata chal sakta hai.

Dusra ye v ek region hai ki PE ratio kisi company ka har quarter nikalta hai but share price roj kuch na kuch fluctuate karta hai. to isi liye PE ratio ka data hamesa consistent nai ho sakta hai but can be used with other indicator.

So kai baar investor apne PEG ratio use karte hain.
