## 1. P/E RATIO:-

P/E ratio is the ratio of the price of per share to its earning per share. it is used to find out if a stock is undervalued or overvalued. 
It signifies the amount of money an investor is willing to invest in a single share of a company for Re. 1 of its earnings. For instance, simple bhasa me kahe agar to  ki kisi company ka P/E ratio agar 20 hai to iska matlab hai ki agar aap uss company ka stock me agar 20 rs lagayenge to aap ek rupya kamayenge. 
So agar high P/E value hai to matlab aap jyada rupya laga rhe hain uss company me to earn one rupee. 
Formula is (CMP/EPS)
***HIGH PE***:- 
So agar kisi company ka PE ratio high hai to iska matlab hai ki company k shares ne earning utna nai diya but price iske badhte jaa rhe hain. uska matlab ye ho sakte hain.
- Company ka share overvalued ho gaya hai and bss price iske badhte jaa rhe hain, but earnings nai badh rhe hain company k.
- Ya to aisa kuch speculation nikal k samne aaya hoga ki company k prifit and growth badhne wale hain future me ya koi acha news nikal k samne aaya hoga. to uss wajah se share badh gaye honge.

***LOW PE:-*** 
Agar kisi company ka PE low hai to it signifies the undervalues stock and considered as a good sign, but not always.
- Ye v ho sakta hai ki company ka koi bura news k wajah se uska share price ghat gaya hai.
- Or else company bura perform kar rhi hai to koi share kharid nai raha hai. 
So hame aur indicators ko use karna padega to know fully, agar company ka PE low hai and all other things are very good then definitely go for it, that will be a purely value investing.
#### Types of Price to Earnings Ratio

There are primarily two types of P/E Ratio which investors take into consideration – forward P/E ratio and trailing P/E ratio. Both these types of P/E Ratio depend on the nature of earnings, as explained below – 

#### Forward P/E Ratio:- 
isko calculate karne k liye hum divide karte hain kisi company k ek single stock price ko with the estimated earning jo ki company future me de sakti hai. bss yehi hai.  it is also called an estimated P/E Ratio. 

Investors use forward Price to Earnings Ratio to assess how a company is expected to perform in the future and its estimated growth rate. 

***How to calculate forward P/E ratio?***
- so first we will calculate the CAGR of the EPS of 3 year or 5 year.
- i can use online calculator, for that i need 3 values. 3 year old eps and latest EPS. and pass the year as 3 in the investement duration section.
- So after getting CAGR, ab humko aane wale sal k liye nikalna hai, to jo CAGR ka amount aaya hai usko agar latest EPS me jor den to aane wale samay ka EPS nikal jayega.
  
```maths
for upcoming EPS:- 
jitna CAGR ka percentage hoga usko latest EPS k sath jor kar nikal do like 
latest EPS = 185
CAGR = 5.40%
agle sal kitna jyada EPS kamayega = 5.40/100 * 185 (percenatage nikal rhe hain current EPS k kitna %)

so upcoming EPS is:- (5.40/100 * 185) + 185;	
```
- So after calculating upcoming EPS we will use the same P/E formula with this new EPS. Which is 
  ```math
  forward p/e = CMP/upcoming EPS
  ```

See this below image to understand the entire calculation method:-

**OBSERVATION:-**
- Forward P/E agar less than current P/E hoga to iska matlab stock undervalued hai.
- Agar forward P/E current P/E k equal hai to iska matlab hai ki stock Fair valued hai.
- Agar forward p/e jyada hai curent P/E ka to iska matlab hai ki stock Overvalued hai.
- lekin sirf isi k dam pr nai. kharid sakte hain hum, Hamko ye v dekhna hoga ki current P/E ratio kahin bahut jyada to nai hai. kyunki agar bahut jyada hai to dikkat hai. like agar cmpany bhale hi undervalued dikhaye but uska P/E ratio agar 20-25 se v upar hai to matlab hai ki company abhi v undervalued hai.
- **One more thind, that agar company mid cap ya small cap hai to waha hum margin of safety dekhenge  margin of safety 27.9 consider kar sakte hain** See the calculator for calculating margin of safety.
#### Trailing P/E Ratio:- 
Trailing P/E Ratio is the most commonly used metrics by investors; wherein past earnings of a company over a period is considered. It provides a more accurate and objective view of a company’s performance.

#### Understanding a good P/E ratio
Jab hum PE ratio dekhte hain to hmko chahiye ki PE ratio dekhne k sath sath ye v dekhe ki uska peer companies ka PE ratio kaisa hai. comparison karne se pata chalega ki kya sabke PE ratio badhe ya ghate hain ys kuch companies k average v hain.

 For eg:- if Company A has a P/E ratio of 40% and Company B with similar characteristics in the same industry demonstrates a ratio of 10% it essentially means that shareholders of company A have to pay Rs. 40 for Re. 1 of their earnings and shareholders of company B have to pay Rs. 10 for Re. 1 of their earnings. Hence, in this instance, investing in Company B might be more profitable.

Waise to PE ratio sirf akela growth ko nai decide karta hai but han value stock ka pata jarur de sakta hai. 
So aaj k samay on an average the PE ration we can consider is 20, because nifty v hamesa 10 to 30 k bich me apna PE ratio maintain karta hai kai salon se to average hum 20 maan sakte hain.

#### Limitations of P/E Ratio
PE ratio akela hi hum bss use nai kar sakte ki stock badhiya hai ya kharab, haan undervalue and overvalue ka pata chal sakta hai.

Dusra ye v ek region hai ki PE ratio kisi company ka har quarter nikalta hai but share price roj kuch na kuch fluctuate karta hai. to isi liye PE ratio ka data hamesa consistent nai ho sakta hai but can be used with other indicator.

So kai baar investor apne PEG ratio use karte hain.

## 2. Price to Book Ratio (P/B):-
Ye ek bahut hi important ratio hai for finding out if a stock is multi-bagger or not.

Formula:- **Price of share / Book value per share**
- **Book value:-** **( total assets - total liabilities)/total outstanding share**. Waise ye info already screener me available hai. so humko calculate karne ki jarurat nai hai waise.
	- Ye ratio batata hai ki ek company ka share kharidne k liye aap kitna times premium de rhe ho. Like agar P/B ratio 8 hai to iska matlab hai ki aap uss company k ek share ko kharidne k liye uss company ka book ratio k 8 gunna jyada premium de rhe ho.
- Waise apne ko P/B ratio nikalne ka jarurat nai hai. ye screener me hai already.
- P/B ratio agar kam hota hai kisi company ka to matlab hai ki company abhi undervalue hai. ya sahi nai kaam kar rhi hai, agar fundamentals strong hain to sahi ho sakta hai
- P/B ratio dhire dhire ghatna chahiye, ya thora thora badhne chahiye to badhiya kehlayega. warna to fir overvalues zone me chala jayega.
- ek acha P/B ratio mana jata hai ki 6 k andar me hi ho.

#### Relationship between the ROE and P/B ratio
- Hamesa P/B ratio kam hona acha hi nai hai, ye tab kam ho jab company k baki k fundamentals majboot ho to acha baat hai.
- Lekin agar company ka P/B ratio jyada hai lekin company ka ROE v badha hua hai to company bhale hi overvalues ho sakti hai because fundamentals strong hai to log kharidte jaa rhe hain share.
- ROE agar 20 k upar hai to mana jata hai ki comapany acha grow kar rhi hain, Bank NBFC's ko chor kar.
- Jaise ki iss image me Hero aur bajaj ka fait value raha not a multi bagger stock. but TvS ek multibagger sabit hua. But kyun?
  ![[Pasted image 20260128134220.png]]
- Kyunki Bajaj aur Hero ka P/B ratio to ghata hai but ROE v ghata hai, although 20 k upar hai to thik hi hai but multibagger nai hai.
- Lekin TVS me p/B ratio to badha hai thora bahut but ROE lagataar badhte gaya hai to ye company bann gaya multibagger. 
  Offcourse kuch aur v indicator honge iske liye.
- **Agar kisi company ka P/B ratio ghat ya bahut aaram se badha and ROE badhta jaa raha hai to matab wo company multibagger banega**

## 3. EV / EBITDA Ratio:- 
Formula hai :- Enterprise value (EV) / EBITDA
```maths
EV (Enterprise value) = (Market cap + Debt) - Cash or Cash equivalent
```

this is the range of EV/EBITDA value, to decide when to buy
![[Pasted image 20260128135142.png]]

#### How to calculate the target and entry price using EV/EBITDA model?
Jis v company ka karna hai, yad rhe ki pehle uske financial analysis complete karne k bad karen.
- EK table banao jisme ki 5 sal ka EV/EBITDA dalo ek row me aur fir 5 sal ka ek dusre row me sirf EV dalo.
- Usme ek aur row rhega EBITDA ka, jisme value humko plot karna hai by dividing EV by EV/EBITDA
- fir usi me table me uska latest year ka debt v rakh lena hai. See all the above point in below image. ![[Pasted image 20260129162435.png]]
- After this EBIDTA plot ho jane k bad hmko EBITDA ka 5 sal ka aur 3 sal ka CARG nikalna hai. and 
- Uske bad hmko expected EBITDA nikalna hai, wo kaise niklega ki latest EBITDA ka CAGR %age nikal denge jo v number aayega, like 5806 ka 5%( CAGR) jo v number aayega wo number ko 5806 me jorr denge. jo nikal kar aayega wo expected EBITDA hoga.
- Fir ab forcasted EV nikalenge, uske liye ye formula use hoga `current EV / EBITDA * expected EBITDA` and isme jo v value aayega uss value se minus kar denge debt.
  
  Ex:- Forecasted EV aaya 5000, so usme minus kar denge debt to wo aa jayega actual forecasted EV hoga.
- AB forecasted EV ko outstanding share jo ki crore me hota hai usually. usko divide kar denge.
  
  now ab jo nikal kar aayega wo **Target price** hoga. But hamesa hamko margin of safety lekar chalna hai. hum apne case me 2/3rd margin safety lekar chalenge jiska value hota hai 0.66. 
- So **entry point** wahi hoga jo margin of safety k bad hmko millega. uska formula hai `target price * 2/3(0.66)`
- See this below image to understand all the mathematical operations step by step.
  ![[Pasted image 20260129164244.png]]
- Now in the below Image the representation of this EV/EBITDA model is shown for TVS motors.
  ![[Pasted image 20260129164423.png]]

## 4. PEG Ratio:- 
Formula for this is:- 
```maths
PEG ratio = P/E ratio / estimated EPS growth rate;
```

![[Pasted image 20260129134318.png]]

- Ye usually ek se niche hota hai to denote karta hai growth pottential hai abhi aur second thing is undervalued dikhta hai.
- ye niche diye gaye table me PEG ratio ko alag alag economic situations k hisab se bataya gaya hai. like GOOD, BAD, NEUTRAL ye economic situations k liye hai. 
- ![[Pasted image 20260129134746.png]]
- Because aisa observe kiya gaya hai ki alag alag economic situations me PEG ratio badalta rehta hai. so for knowing the valuation of a stock i can refer to this table.
