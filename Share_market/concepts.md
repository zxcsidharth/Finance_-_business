### TERMS:-
- ***OWNERS EQUITY***:- this is also called as Net Equity. 
  Net Equity = Total assets - Borrowings( jo karz ya kisi se liya gaya ho)
  Borrowings can be termed as liabilities. jo ki liye gaye loans ya paise hote hai. 
  aur agar koi business band ho jata hai to uss case me sare liabilities ko clear karna padta hai owners ko.
  
- ***PROMOTERS***:- a group of people or single person who started the company and want to promote it going ahead.
- ***PROTECTION AGAINST DEFAULTS***:-  if some company gets bankrupt then SEBI will ensure that the shareholders gets the money. By selling the asset of the company. (there are various rules that who will be the first people to get the money if a company gets defaulted)
- ***IPO***:- initial public offer, jab kisi company ko first time market se fund raise karna hota hai to uss time company IPO nikalte hain. So companies ko paisa isi se milta hai bad me NSE, BSE se share buy/sell hota hai usse company ko kuch paisa nai milta hai.
- ***FPO***:- Follow-on public offer. jab company ko market se aur paise chahiye hota hai to uss time companies FPO nikalte hain, kyunki company k pass to paisa bss IPO se hi jata hai bad me secondary market se company ko paisa nai milta hai.
- ***PRIMARY MARKET***:- where company directly sells the share to the investor but SEBI will also be there as the sole authority.
- ***SECONDARY MARKET***:-  Share market, like NSE BSE.
  ![[Pasted image 20241128103334.png]]
         this is the diagram to see how primary and secondary market runs.

- ***LISTING ON AN EXCHANGE***:- jab hum koi share kharid bech karte hain to uss case me to wo hamare demat account me list hota hai.. usi ko listing kehte hain.
- ***UNDERWRITERS***:- Wo financial institutions jo kisi company k sara financial details read karne k bad SEBI ya required person ko batati hain ki unka kitna ka valuation hai aur agar company ko IPO release karna hai to per share wo kitna rakhenge price.
- ***FIXED PRICE ISSUE:-*** IPO k time pr jab company fixed price rakh deti hai to usko ye kehte hain
- ***BOOK BUILD ISSUE:-*** company ek fixed price na deti hai instead ki wo range de deti hai like 200 - 220 k bich me per share price hona chahiye. jyadatar yehi wala issue market me release hota hai. 
- ***MARKET VALUE:-*** jo share ka current price hai usi ko market value bolte hain. and wo har roj change hote rehta hai.
- ***FV***:- when used in the context of share then its called as "Face value" but when used in context of the money then it is called as "future value". So face value is nothing but jab share ka IPO hone ka bad jo v uska initial price tha usi ko face value kehte hain. uske bad fir chahe jitna badhe ya ghate usko hum face value nai bolenge.
- ***DIVIDEND***:- Jo company ne profit kamaya usko shaare share holder me band diya gaya. sabko kuch kuch percentage millega like 5-10%.
- ***CORPORATE ACTIONS:-*** Matlab uss company k board of directory me kya kya action liya jata hai usi ko corporate actions kehte hain. so jab hum kisi share ka fundamental analysis kare to ye v dekhna jaruri hai, kyunki isse ye pata chalega ki company ne kya kya kiya hai apne shareholder ka, aur usse ye v pata chalega ki company apne shareholder k liye kitna serious hai.
- ***TURNOVER:-*** jo company ka total sales hota hai usi ko turnover kehte hain.
- ***TOPLINE:-*** turnover ko hi topline growth v bolte hain, so hame kisi share ko analyse karne me ye v dekhna hota hai ki company ka topline growth kaisa hai. sales badh rhe hain ya nai. **_Sometimes kisi company me aisa v hota hai ki sales to badh raha hai but profit margin ghatata jaa raha hai. to waha hame thora deep proper analysis karna hoga._**
- ***BOTTOMLINE:-*** Profit after tax ko bottomline bolte hain, so sometimes hame ye v dhyan rakhna hoga ki kai baar company ka profit to hua hai 100 cr but uske pass abhi 10 crore aaye nai hain. to yaha pr bottomline growth 90 crore ka hi hoga.

  Ex:- in the below image, if i see the table the i can see that there is an increase in the turnover and sales also but initially in the year 2016 the PAT(Profit after tax) is 10% of the turnover, and this is around 10% till 2019 but after that the PAT decreases and this shows that there is something wrong in the company, ek ideal situation wo hota hai jab company ka turnover and pat % also grow, basically turnover k sath sath PAT v usi ratio me grow karna chahiye.
  
  Atleast badhe na to utna v to rhe.
  ![[Pasted image 20241129115549.png]]

- ***BLUECHIP***:- Unn companies ko bolte hain jo ki Large cap aur Mid cap k andar ki badi compaies hoti hain unko bolte hain blue chip companies
### Details about IPO:-

IPO's are categorised into two parts. See the diagram to understand the two parts.
![[Pasted image 20241128104615.png]]

**Fresh Issue** :- isme aate hain new shares and uss share se company ko milte hain paise, but jo shareholding % hai investor ka wo kam ho jata hai because company k kuch % share market me dilute karna padta hai.

**Offer for sale**:- Ye kya hota hai ki koi new share nai aata hai isme ek tarah se company ko hi bech di jati hai kisi aur owner ko. t jo v isme 51% stake kharid lega wo comapny ka new ownew ban jayega. to isse company ko koi naya capital nai milta hai.

**Price bidding process**:- Jab IPO release hota hai to uss time pr per share price k range hote hain, aur har aadmi apne according kuch price pr number of share ko allocate karne ka bid rakhta hai. and then jab company bids ko process karti hain to uss case me company sabse pehle unn bidders ka request ko process karti hain jinka highest price pr bidding hua ho. aur agar company k sare share bik gaye high wale bidding me hi to jo low bid rakhe honge unko kuch v share millega hi nai. unko tabhi milta hai jab higher wale ko dene k bad jo bach jaye.

![[Pasted image 20241128113852.png]]
#### Price setting:-
Ek share kitne rupay ka hai ye kaise pata chalega. ye kaam IPO k time pr underwritters ka hota hai wo company k sare details read karne k baad batayenge ki company ko ki company ka valuation 10 crore ka hai suppose and company 5 crore raise karna chahti hai, to uss case me company ko apne share holding ka 50% stake dena padega, and then jab dena padega to uss case me 5 crore ka stake matlab company ko dena padega bidders ko. to ab company ko ye pata chal gaya ki kitna per share price hoga aur kitna ka total paisa unko lena hai market se. to total money divided by per share karne pr total number of share ka v pata chal jayega.

Now ek baar shares secondary market me aa gaye and trade hone lage to wha pr jo price settings hoga wo aise hoga.
jaise ki jo v seller ka demand hoga agar wo loss me bech kar bhagna chahte hain to uss case me thora sa price down ho jayega aur agar koi kharidne wala nai millega to aur down hoga. But let's say majority log jo hain share k price pr ya usse jyada price pr buy karne ka price set karte hain to uss case me share price badh jayega.


>[!note] Worth to Remember
> 
>Market value ko dekh kar kabhi v investement na karen, waha zero safety hai.
>Always see the intrinsic value

### Difference between Intrinsic value and Market value.

**Intrinsic value:-** (IV)
- Means fair/real value of a share.
- Hamesa share intrinsic value pr ya usse kam pr hi kharide

#### Intrinsic Value Calculation:- 
- ***Personal Perception:-*** ye tab kaam aata hai jab hame jankari behtar ho aur hamare pass info ho.
- ***Compare with other companies*** :- it means usi sector k other stocks se compare karna like koi other company k stocks jo ki badh rhe ho kafi tezzi se, ya uss sector ko kuch special chutt milla ho. ya kisi tarah ka koi baat hai kya jiske wajah se share bss ek ka badhta jaa raha hai aur kisi ka nai badh raha hai.
- ***Discounted cash flow modal***:- this is also known as "Conservative approach"  jaise ki hame kisi given principle or 5% ka CAGR nikalna hai to hum compounding calculator ka use karte hain. so usi tarah agar hmko future value koi bata dega aur intrest bata dega to hum discouted value nikalte hain ki agar itna future me dega aur itne % ka growth deta hai  to matlab ki kitna rupya ka initial amount hoga after passing X year (i mean investement amount)
- Matlab ek taraf se compounding ka reverse hai ye.
- To online agar directly mai search karunga ki "discounted cash flow calculator" dhundh kar isse hame share ka intrinsic value ka pata chal jayega.

**Why this is important to check this?**
 - Because kai bar companies ya bade bade traders jhuthe news faila dete hain taki share price shoot kar jaye aur fir ya to wo company FPO launch kare ya jyada se jyada investor ko attract karne k liye ye sab v kiya jata hai.
- So kabhi v share buy karne se pehle uska intrinsic value jarur nikalen, agar wo overvalued hai to usme investement nai karna hai aur wo pakka kisi din apne original value pr aayega.
- agar undervalued hai hum kharid sakte hain.
- also before buying thora sa trends v dekhna jaruri hai like uss sector ki aur companies ka kya performance hai aur agar koi companies ka trends ulta chal raha ho to iska matlab kuch to gadbad hai.

### Share Split:-

Ye bascially share ko break karna kehlata hai. 
isko sajhte hain ek example se, like ek company hai aur uska share price suppose 1500 hai per share. and company ne socha ki ab hum apne 1 single stock ko split kar dete hain in the 1:5 ratio. Means breakdown 1 share into 5 shares.so 1500 ka ek share now split ho gaya 5 share me jiska ki price per share ho jayega 1500/5 = 300 rs per share. so now this 300 will be the new face value of the share of that company. 

usually share split ek acha indication hota hai company growth ka, kyunki company share ko split kab karti hai??
Jab share ka price utna high ho jata hai ki jitna company ko lagta hai ki new company hai ya utna reknown company nai hai aur share price kafi badh gaye hain to new user ab invest karne se sochenge. so investor ko attract karne k liye.

***so isse ye v pata chalta hai ki company investor k liye v kaam karna chahti hai aur inko serious lekar chalti hai***

SUMMARY:- 
1:5 -> means every single share will be broken down into 5 shares. 

### Bonus share:-
yaha pr kya hota hai ki koi company apne share holder ko aur kuch share bonus me khud se deti hai. for eg:

agar mai infosys ka share holder hu aur usne diya hai bonus to wo aise bolenge ki hum apne shareholder ko bonus denge on 1:4.
yaha pr 1:4 means for every 4 share we will give 1 bonus share.

to bahut sari companies hain jo bonus share deti hain and unse bahut fayda hota hai ong run me.

SUMMARY:-
1:5 -> yaha pr split ki tarah nai hota hai, yaha pr for every 5 share they will give an extra share.

### Right issue:-
Agar koi company ne apne share holders ne koi special previlledge ya right diya to uss case me kehte hain ki company apne shareholder ko favour de rhi hai so that they buy more share.

Ye tabhi aati hai jab company wants to grow their capital. ye jyadatar companies nai karte hain.

iska ek disadvantage ye v hai ki kai bar company dubti hai ya fraud kar k nikalna chahti ho to uss case me kam paise pr logo se paise lekar nikalna chahti ho. 
ya debt badh gaya to paise uthana chahti hai.
ya fir profit kam ho raha hai and operation cost maintain karna chahti hai.

>[!faq] Do you know?
>Jab v koi company right issue karti hai to uss case me hame khush hokar kharid nai lena hai balki hame deep analysis karna chahiye ki bhai isko kya jarurat hai, aakhir paise ki jarurat positive karan se hai ya negative karan hai.

>[!info] Very Important
>Jo v company bonus, dividend, rights ya splits deti hai wo company mana jaa sakta hai ki sahi kaam kar rhi hai.

## Fundamental and Technical Analysis:-

this is the market timing. (9:15 to 3:30) time hota hai for retail investor.

![[Pasted image 20241130124026.png]]

***AMH***:- After market hours , ye kab hota hai?? ye hota hai 4pm from previous day to 9:00 am in next day.

***AMO***:- After market orders. (isme hum buy ya sell v kar sakte hain) jaise ki jo working people hain wo rat me hi order place kar dete hain.

***LTP***:- Last traded price bolte hain isko. iska matlab jab 3:30 pr market close hua tha tab jo last price tha uss share ka usi ko bolte hain LTP.

ek example hai ki agar koi share ka LTP 40 rs ho to agle din 9 bje iska dam dusra hoga kyunki post market order lagenge to iska dam kuch ghatega ya badhega. aur fir usi share ka dam 9:15 k baad aur badh jayega ya ghat jayega kyunki in the pre market session brokers log trader karte hain.

So now why Brokers trade but not investor??

-> Because market k volatility ko maintain karne k liye SEBI ne ye rula banaya hai. taki koi share ko jitna girna ya badhna rhega to wo badh kar ya ghat kar apne normal state me chala jayega because till then brokers trade kar k uss share ka jo hona hoga wo kar denge to jab normal aadmi k hath me aayega tab bahut jyada volatility nai rhega.

***GAP UP***:- Kal k market ka close hone k price se aaj market khulne k bad share me uchal dikhe agar to usko Gap up kehte ain, kyunki wo share opening hi hua hai higher price se because of pre market orders.

***GAP DOWN***:- Kal k market ka close hone k price se aaj market khulne k bad share me downfall dikhe agar to usko Gap down kehte ain, kyunki wo share opening hi hua hai lower price se compared to previous day closing price. because of pre market orders.

***DIVIDEND YIELD***:- ye percentage me hota hai aur iska matlab hai ki company ne itne percent ka dividend diya hai per share.

***ROCE***:- Return on capital employeed

***ROE***:- 
#### Types of Orders:-

***STOP LOSS***:- matlab ki loss me jab ho tab kitna loss me bech sakta hu to uske liye hum stop loss lagate hain usse kya hoga ki hamara share loss hoga to uss particular amount pr aate hi bikk jayega agar stop loss order ko touch kiya hai.

***TRIGGER PEICE***:- suppose hamara stock ka price hai 1000 aur maine stop loss lagaya 990 ka with 1% loss margin. so kai baar kya hota hai ki price jab bahut tezzi se girta hai to stop loss me sell nai hota hai. to uss case me hum trigger price lagate hain nearbuy to stop loss price like yaha pr iss cas eme 993 pr laga denge. so now jaise hi itna price pahunchega to kya hoga ki order book se nikal  trade book me chala jayega. aur fir jo v market me price millega uspr ye bik jayega. ye wait nai karega STOP LOSS ppr jane ka.

***IOC***:- Immediate or cancel order. jaise order **dete** samay maine dala hai ki 708.30 ka to iska matlab ki ye itne price pr abhi do ya rehne do. to basically ye market price ko dekh kar dala jata hai..to jo market price hai usi k around me set hota hai. this is similar to market orders but market orders me slippage ho sakta hai aur yaha pr slippage ka koi chance nai hai.

#### Market Capitalisation

Matlab uss company k total assets including cashflow and assets. ye do tarah k hote hain 
1. ***CONSOLIDATED***:- matlab ki uski kuch subsidiary company v hongi unn sabka mila kar jo capital hoga wo hoga iss case me MC.
2. ***STANDALONE***:- Matlab excluding the subsidiary companies. bss purely usi ka capitalisation ka baat ho.

Formula for MC = NO. of share * Latest traded price;

PS:- PEERS ka matlab hota hai ki usi fields ki companies.

**categorisation**:-based on the market cap this is divided into three parts.
1. ***LARGE CAP***:- Market cap >= 10000 cr.
2. ***MID CAP***:- 500cr >= MC <= 10000 cr.
3. ***SMALL CAP***:- MC < 500.

***FREE FLOAT***:-  **Kai baar hum dekhenge ki Market Cap k baju me Free float v likha hota hai? What is that?**
Let's understand this with an example, that lets say a company has 100000 shares but out of 10 lakh the promoters holds the 6 lakh shares, so the remaining 4 lakhs would be here to trade for the retail investeor, Institutional Investor and HNI (high networth individual) 

so Free float is  = (total Shares - Promoters holding) * price per share.

so ye ho jayega free float and agar iko minus kar denge market cap se to promoters ka holding v pata chal jayega.

So now agar ek company me agar founders/promoters ka share acha khasa hai to iska matlab ki company k growth pr ya founders pr bharosa kara jaa sakta hai.

>[!info] Conclusion
>So now concluding this as ki agar Founders k holding jyada hain to Free flow share kam honge aur free flow jiss v share ka kam hoga uss share pr jyada bharos karne ka

See this below image to see the difference. 
![[Pasted image 20241203195002.png]]


#### What does selling of Promoters share means for the market??

So when a promoter sells the share then there could be the two case.
1. **Lack of funds**:- they might have lack of funds, or they may be loosing trust on the company, so overall this would be a bad news.
2. **Comply with SEBI guidelines**:- SEBI has a rule that if any company wants to go public then the promoters must have to dissolve the 25% share in the market ad they can hold a maximum of 75% share. so in some cases the promoters took more than 75% may be because during the IPO they could be only able to sell the 22 % of the share in the public so the remaining they had to keep with themself. so in this case if they are selling than this is not a -ve news, but this is a positive news.  and if the company is of growing mature then during that time usually the price falls down so we can buy that share and in long run it may give very good return.
3. 
#### SEBI action to prevent stock manipulation:-
jab koi share bahut tezi se upar jaa raha ho to uss case me sebi ne apne side se har share k liye limit laga rakha hai ki ek share kitna uppar jaa sakta hai, so how does this limit works??

Lets say agar koi share bahut tezzi se upar jane laga to ek time pr SEBI kya karegi ki uss company me koi v trade karna band kar degi for 45 min (pause). uss dauran koi v na bech payega aur na hi kharid payega.

ab 45 Min baad fir se resume karenge SEBI wale fr 30 min, aur dekhenge ki kya share fir se bahut tezi se badhne laga to uss case me kya hoga ki fir iss share ko pure din k liye trading band kar denge, even within 30 min, (matlab ki dusri baar me 30 min paar hone ka wait nai karenge, balki turant rok diya jayega) and wo price jo touch kara hai share ne band hone se pehle usko bolte hain **UPPER CIRCUIT** aur same agar sahre gir raha hai to hoa aur jo uss range ka last price touch ho jayega to usko bolenge **LOWER CIRCUIT** 
![[Pasted image 20241202095406.png]]

Matlab ki ek din me ek share ek range se jyada nai badh sakta hai aur na hi ghat sakta hai.

Now Question is ki **iss range ko kaise aur kaun decide karta hai?**
So ye SEBI ne right diya hai BSE and NSE ko ki aap apne andar listed companies ka ek range decide kar k uspr limit apply kariye.

So Allowable % of circuit  (UPPER/LOWER)
2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%. of Last day traded price. 

ye depend karta hai company kis nature ki hai, agar kuch aise sector ki hogi jaha volatility jyada hoga to waha limit thora jyada rhega aur share stable type ki hai to waha range limit kam rhega. 

iss ekya hoga ki investors k sharee paise dubenge nai maximum uss ange me hi paise dub sakte hain.

***EXCEPTION***:- jo companies Future&option me v trade karti hain wo companies k liye upper circuit aur lower circuit bss ek formality hai because wo jaise hi uss limit ko cross karenge waise hi turant unka naya limit unlock ho jayega. TO iss tarah ki companies me abhi v stock manipulation chal rhe hain, like ring trading and all. 

#### Understanding Nifty & Sensex.

Nifty is the index of NSE top 50 companies. and this terms is derived from N from NSE + IFTY from FIFTY.

Similarly Sensex is the index of BSE. 

Now how the index value calculates for the NSE or nifty.??
-> Wo aise hota hai ki jitne v companies uss index me listed hain.. unn comapnies k share me agar badhaw ya ghataw hoga to wo index ka value up and down hoga.
So initially jab NIFTY suru hua tha tab let's say index ka ek base value mana gaya tha suppose 100 ab uss time se lekar ab tak jo v nifty ka inde ka value hoga wo totally depend karta hai uske andar listed jo 50 companies hain unke share price se.

jaise nifty50 ka index hai waise hi nifty me kai alag alag category hai jiska ki apna index hai. like NIFTY BANK (all companies of NSE banks), NIFTY Infra (all companies of NSE infra), NIFTY PSU, NIFTY PHARMA (top NSE pharma companies). 

>[!faq] Do you know??
>Now kai bar wo companies jo BSE me listed hain but NSE me listed nai hain.. to aksar jab wo listing hota hai to unka share ma jabardast uchal aata hai. Aise stocks pr ya news pr najaar bana k rakhna bahut jaruri hai
>Agar mill jata hai wo share to ayd rakhna ki mahine me 20% ka return wo de degi aaram se.

**SO does 1% increase in nifty means that all companies under nifty also grew by 1%??**
--> No it does not mean the same, because there would be many companies grew by 3% many were declined by 4%  or to some other percentage.


### Pledging Of shares:-

It means that promoters apne shares ko thora thora kar k dissolve karte hain, aur aisa khabar kai bar failate hain ki wo apna kharcha pani ya personal paise ki jarurat ki wajah se karen hain. But samajhne wala baat ye hai ki agar wo ye kaam bar baar kar rhe hain to wo bahut hi negative sentiment hai, and then the investor need to be alert. 

Bahut sare bade bade portals claim karte hain ki Pledging koi negative chij nai hai founders karte rehte hain time to time, But don't listen to them this is very strong negative things. even koi founders first time v pledge karte hain to uss case me deep research karo ki bhai kahin koi profit margin ya sale ya kuch to inke finance me gadbad to nai hai. Because aise bechte behte wo to fir ek din apna holding to pura karm kar lenge and then fir nikal lenge market se bahar.

***SIPHONING OF FUNDS***:- Iska matlab hai ki promoters apne share ko lagatar pledge kar rhe hain. pledge karne k piche do motive ho sakte hain..
1. Company growth:- agar ye hain to kuch hadd tak bear kar sakte hain.
2. or personal growth:- tab to bhaiya bahut bada negative sign hai.. because promoter apna kharcha chala rhe hain usi se..aur ye SEBI k according ek bahut hi unlawfull activities hain. and aise company me to fir bhul kar v paise nai dalne hain.
So jaha v kahin kisi company me dikhe ki SIPHONING hui hai to waha se khisak lene ka..

>[!info] NOTE:
>Agar koi company k promoters pledge kar kar fir kuch time pr unpleadging v kar rhe hain to its a good sign.


#### Book value vs Market value/current price:-
Book value matlab ki kisi share ka original price kya hoga agar uske sare assets ko calculate kar k uska price nikala jaye to kya hoga..wo jo price hoga uss price ko total share se divide kar denge to book value mill jata hai. But ye nikal pana bahut difficult hota hai for individual investor so ye info companies hi jyadatar case me reveal karti hai.

NOTE:- agar kabhi kisi share ka market value agar book value k pass me ya usse kam hai to uss case me wo share acha return de sakta hai agar uske baki sab finances and analysis sahi hai to. But yad rhe ki uske sare finances agar thik ho tabhi le.. warna ye v ho sakta hai ki loss k wajah se company k share gir gaye ho aur wo company ka sahre obviously book value se kam hi ho jayega.
Also jo book value since assets k upar calculate hota hai, to uss case me jo assets ka price hota hai wo uss assets ka kharida hua hi price k upar hi book value calculate hota hai, jabki assets v badhte hain time k sath. Like agar koi company ne 100 sal pehle land kharida hoga to book value uss 100 sal pehle k land k price pr calculate hoga, jab ki abhi uss land ka keemat sayad bahut jyada ho sakta hai. so remember this also.

See the below image to understand more

![[Pasted image 20241208143840.png]]
Book value agar current share price se bahut jyada v kam hai to v dikkat ki baat hai, uss share pr thora aur time bitanana hai on analysis. like agar book value kisi share ka 10-15 gunna kam hai uske current price k to thora alert rhen.

so dono extreme se bachna hai like book value jab jyada hi kaam ho jaye ya jab jyada hi badh jaye to v un companies ka thora dekhna hai.

#### P/E Ratio:-
we can find this ratio for stock as well as for the company.
stock (price/earning) = (price per share/ earning per share in one year)
for company (P/E) = total market cap / earning per year

for example for stocks:-

let's say one share has a price of 100 rs and in one year it gave a profit of 20 rs, 
so P/E = 100/20 = 5. it means that in 5 year if this stock gives same kind of return then it will gets double. 
P/E ratio ko payback time v kehte hain it means ki jitna humne lagaya tha utna hmko return kitne time me aa jayega.
***NOTE***:- Ye indicator trading k liye nai hai, ye indicator use karna important hota hai for long term investing.

So we should look for the **EPS** which is know as the earnings per share. to agar kisi stock ka EPS let's say 70 hai to iska matlab ki ek stock pr pichle ek sal me 70 rupay ka profit hua hai agar uss stock to sahi price pr kharida gaya ho to, agar high price pr koi kharidega to obviously utna profit nai millega.

#### ROCE & ROE
this is known as return on capital employed. iska matlab hai ki company ne jitne jitne capital kharch kare the uspr unko kitna percent return mill paya hai. matlab ki company kitna percent paisa kama pai apne capital pr. ab company ka capital matlab company ka apna capital + borrowings milla kar total capital banta hai. to jo ROCE calculate hota hai wo total capital pr hota hai. kai baar borrowings nai hote hain to own capital hi total capital hota hai.

![[Pasted image 20241211083404.png]]

Yad rhe ki ROCE agar kisi company ka badhiya nai hai to wo aapko kaha se badhiya return dega jab wo khud ko hi utna acha return nai de pa rhe hain.
In the below image, based on ROCE companies are divided into great and good companies. jis company ka ROCE less than 15% hai to uss company me koi investement nai karna hai. kyunki jab wo khud ko 15% nai de paa rhe hain to mujhe kaha se return denge utna.

![[Pasted image 20241211083712.png]]

**ROE** means return on equity means apne shareholder ko kitna % return diya hai ek saal me.

***DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO***:- Matlab company pr kitna karjj hai total, with respect to the equities of promoters or retail investors.

in the below image it is shown that how should a company can be categorised if it has certain percentage of debt. 

![[Pasted image 20241211093026.png]]

>[!tip] Exception
>Don't see the ROCE and Debt to equity ratio for the banks because unka sara capital to market me already dusro k pass hota hai aur ye debt dekar hi to profit earn karti hain. so inka DER high rehta hai & ROCE low rehta hai. 
>But unka ROE acha ho sakta hai jo acha performer hain.

***DEBTOR DAYS***:- iska matlab ki company agar kisi se karz leti hai to kitne din me wapas kar deti hai, ye data banks k liye bada helpfull hota hai jisse ki bank wale loan dena ya nai dena hai decide karte hain.

***PIOTRISKI SCORE***:- ye teen chij se mill kar bana hai profitability, leverage and operating efficiency, and ye bahut hi helpful hota hai, like ye zero to 9 k bich me hota hai score. And ye jitna jyada rhega utna badhiya rhega company ka return, like agar 9 hai to sabse badhiya, but for our analysis hum isko 5-6 k upar k values ko consider karenge. ye 
### Profit & loss analysis:-
Sale me se expense ko ghata denge to company ka **operating cost** nikalta hai.

***OTHER INCOME/OTHER SOURCE***:- matlab compay ne kitna kamaya hai other sources k through, agar company ka other source of income badh raha hai to iska matlab company acha perform kar rhi hai and company ka management seriously kaam kar raha hai and apne asets ka sahi use kar raha hai.

***INTREST***:- Matlab ki apne karj pr har sal company kitna kitna intrest pay kar rhi hai..aur over the time agar intrest kam hote jaa rhe hain to iska matlab company ka acha growth hai and acha performance mindset hai ki apna karzz ko company dhire dhire kam karna chah rhi hai.

***DEPRECIATION***:- Matlab ki har company k kuch kuch assets aise hote hain ki wo depreciate karte hain over the time, to wo v data present hota hai har sal ka, aur agar company grow karte jaa rhi hai to Depreciation v badhega hi because company k resources v to badh rhe hain. And depreciation k badhne se koi dikkat nai hai unless and untill company ka profit v agar badh raha hai to. problem tab hai jab company ka profit nai badh raha hai but depreciation badhta jaa raha hai and profit nai badh raha hai .. then iska matlab company me kuch serious issues hain.

NOTE:- agar net profit sahi nai baith raha hai aur depreciation badhta jaa raha hai to bahut jyada chances hai ki company loan leki ya funds raise karenge share bech kar ya promoters apna share pledge karenge. 

***EBITDA/OPERATING COST MARGIN***:- 

***OPM***:- 
### Balance Sheet analysis:-

***OTHER LIABILITIES***:- ye to pata hi hai ki liabilities kya hai and other liabilities means that ki company k upar aur kya kya liabilities hain. ye bahut jyada nai hone chahiye.

***CWIP***:- stands for "Capital work in progress"
iska matlab hai ki company ne aaj k date me kitna paisa laga rakha hai apne kaam ko aage badhane k liye ya manage karne k liye. like koi plant lag raha hoga ya showroom khul raha hoga. Jitne v manufacturing based companies hain waha pr CWIP jyada hota hai, kyun ki yaha physical space jyada lagta hai. but service based companies ka CWIP kafi kaam hota hai. So iska hamare decision making me koi fark nai padta, infact agar high hai for manufacturing company to acha sign hai ki company kaam kar rhi hai..management serious hai on growth.

***INVESTEMENT***:- matlab company kahin aur invest kar rhi hai..to wo badhta hua dikhe to acha sign hai.

>[!tip] Please remember.
>Total liability will be equal to total assets in the balance sheet. agar nai hai to gadbad hai, iska matlab ki company jitna le rhi hai utna kharcha ho nai raha hai.

### Cash Flow Analysis:-

***CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITY***:- matlab apne operating activity se company ne kitna cash generate kar paa rhi hai, and agar ye badhta hai to company ka acha growth show karta hai. Its a good sign.

### Share holding pattern:-
in this section it will tell us that how much percentage of share does promoters hold and kitna FII's k pass hai and kitna DII's k pass hai and then finally public k pass kitna share hai. 

Agar public k pass share kam hai to achi baat hai ki ya to promoters k pass jyada hain ya FII or DII k pass hain because wo strong hand ka support hai uss share ko.
Public ka matlab retail investor + HNI v ho sakte hain (high networth income individuals)

### How much to Invest:-

keep a rule that i will not spend more than 20% of my income. so always put less than 20% of my income in market. usse jyada kuch v ho jaye wo nai dalna hai. 

### Stock manipulation examples:-

***CASE 1***:- RING TRADING:-
ye kya hota hai ki kuch bade brokers suppose 10 tho honge jo ek dusre ko jante honge aur unke bich me ye setting hoga ki hum sab ek dusre ko hi share kharid bech karenge aur per share 20 rs ka profit rakhnege suppose.
EG:-
1. Person A 100000 share kharida rs 80 per share.
2. Then usne becha 100000 shares ko aur order jo lagaya wo **AON** hai. it means kharidne wala wahi kharid sakta hai jo ek aadmi shara share ek sath kharide.
   To uss case me person B hoga wo same 100000 share ka order place kar dega with 100rs per share.
3. Abhi ye Person B v bechaega same way 20 rs ka margin lekar aur Person C v kharid lega 120 rs per share k hisab se..aise karte karte jo last banda hoga wo v kharid k apna profit nikal k bechega but iss time kharidega fir se Person A, so its like a circle or ring. ab last wala jo banda hai wo kya karega ki pura share ek sath na bech kar 5000 share bechega taki SEBI k najar me naa aaye.
4. Aur Fir aise kar k sabka profit nikal jayega aur sare brokers ne karib karib 20 lakh ka profit kama liya. 
5. Ab isme nuksan kiska hoga, unn logo ka jo badhta hua price dekh kar paise dal diye ki are ye to badh raha hai. aisa soch kar dal diye aur fir wo ye scammers k jane k baad uss company ka stock dhadam se gir jayega. aur unka shara paisa dub jayega. 
6. To isse bachne k liye kya kare ki jab v koi company ka share badh raha hai acha speed se aur kuch hi dino me ye badhna suru hua hai to paise dalne se pehle research karo ki kya company ne koi positive news diya. 
7. kya sirf wahi company ka share badh raha hai ya uske PEERS company ka v share badh raha hai. aur agar badh raha hai to kya pure sector k liye koi good news hai jo badh raha hai.


### Trends to note down:-

***Jab v kisi company ka share badhne lage bahut tezzi se to ye niche diye gaye trends k bare me padh lo dhyan se***

- Agar koi news nai aaya hai ya company ne koi positive corporate action nai liya hai to v agar share badhte chale jaa rhe hain to ekdum dur ho jana hai uss share se. wo jyadatar chance hai ki scam ho raha hoga. ya share manipulate ho raha hoga.

NOTE:- hamesa analysis kam se kam 5 sal ka karen kisi v company ka.
