- ye wo investement hota hai jo ki NSE top 50 companies me invest karta hai, and kafi secure mana jata hai, because all are large cap companies, so acha return de deti hain


investement karne se pehle apna age goal set karo and then money goal set karo and then calculate ki kitne ka return millega to you will be able to achieve that.
agar short term me kuch paise kamane hain to then you will have to rely on the other form of investement like stock, equity maybe hybrid mutual fund and other form of investement because for a short term like 5-8 years you can not rely on the mutual fund investement, you will have to be intelligent enough to invest in other form of investement.

Equity small cap me invest kar sakte hain for short term and for long term(for more than 20 year) i can choose large cap top 50.

Mutual funds plans are of two types:-
1. Regular plan:- isme kya hota hai bich ka koi party involve hota hai like bank ya koi agent jo wo v hmse kuch commision khata hai.
2. Direct Plan:- Isme kya hota hai ki hum direct uss mutual fund me paisa dal rhe hote hain jinme hmko dalna hai bich me koi nai hota hai jo paisa khaye


Mutual funds are  of two types:- 
1. Growth:- isme kya hota hai ki agar ek sal k investement ka suppose return 10 % aaya to wo usi me add ho jayega and uspr coumponding chalega.
2. Dividend:- Isme kya hoga ki jo 10% ka return aayega wo aapke bank account me har sal nikal k dal denge, but iska loss kya hai ki isme aapke base balance to utne ho reh jayenge hamesa so compounding nai hoga yaha pr.


Now my investement journey have to be started like this way:-

I will invest in small cap with 20 % of my money.
I will invest in mid cap with 15% and 15% in large cap.

Search about all the Large cap companies and mid cap companies ko searchkar k nikalo aur agar acha rhega to usme lumpsum investement karo.


#### How to pick a best mutual fund?
- Expense ratio deko selected mutual funds ka.
-  Expense ratio jyada mai pay kar sakta hu kisi funds ko but uska return jyada hona chahiye.
- kam retruns me jyada expense ratio wala funds nai lena hai
- Trackig error dekh sakte hain wo jitna kam ho utna better hai. ( to check that i can see this website) (https://www.valueresearchonline.com/amfi/tracking-error/)
- Jo v mututal fund ka analysis mujhe karna hai uska research karn sakta hu jaise ki uska jo v fund manager hoga usko value research website pr jaa kar check akr sakta hu uss fund manager ka experience, Basically fund manager ka acha khasa long term ka uska experience dekha hai, aur wo aur kaun kaun sa aur other fund manage kar raha hai, fir ye dekhna hai ki wo jis jis fund ko manage kar rhe hain wo kaisa perform kara hai
  
  

Kuch kuch ache fund manager ko dekh sakta hu ki wo abhi kis fund ko manage kar rhe hain:
1. Sohini andani
2. Vinit Sambre - DSP
3. Rajiv Thakkar - Parag Parikh 
4. Nilesh Surana - Mirae Asset
5. jinesh gopani
